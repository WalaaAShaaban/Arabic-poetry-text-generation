# Arabic-poetry-text-generation
In this Capstone project, you will develop a text generation model for Arabic poetry. The goal of the project is to build a model that can generate high-quality Arabic poems that follow the rules of Arabic poetry, including meter, rhyme, and structure.

To get started, you can use a dataset of Arabic poems, such as the Diwan Al-Mutanabbi (ديوان المتنبي), which is a collection of poems by the famous Arabic poet Al-Mutanabbi. You can preprocess the data to prepare it for the text generation model.

Next, you can use a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow to build and train a text generation model, such as a GPT. You can fine-tune the model on the Arabic poetry dataset to optimize its performance for generating Arabic poetry.

To evaluate the performance of the model, you can use metrics such as perplexity and BLEU score to measure the quality of the generated poems. You can also conduct user testing to get feedback on the generated poems and identify areas for improvement.

This Capstone project will help you develop skills in natural language processing, deep learning, and Arabic language, and provide experience in building a text generation model for Arabic poetry.
